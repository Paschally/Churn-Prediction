App Summary:

This Streamlit app is designed to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their provided data. 
The app leverages a pre-trained machine learning model using Logistic Regression, 
and it takes user inputs through an interactive form to determine customer-specific features.


**User Input Form**: Users input various customer details such as gender, senior citizen status,
tenure, internet and phone service usage, payment method, and monthly charges, among other factors.

**Model Prediction**: Once the user submits the data, the app processes the information using
a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of customer churn.

**Prediction Output**: After the 'Predict Churn' button is clicked, the app displays a result, 
indicating whether the customer is predicted to churn or not (i.e., "Churn" or "Not Churn"). 
The app provides an interactive way to explore customer behavior and supports decision-making
around customer retention by giving insights into potential churn scenarios.
